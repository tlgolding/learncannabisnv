<h1>Budtending Best Practices</h1>

<h2>Here are just some general best practices that I have come across while working in dispensaries and with customers:</h2>

<h4>Always confirm each item in the order.</h4>
<p>Since it is sometimes difficult to process returns or void transactions, try to review and confirm each item with the guest to ensure that hey are the correct, desired item. It will not prevent all situations from ending in mistakes or mind changes, but it's the best way to avoid it.</p>

<h4>Be firm about the law</h4>
<p>When handling customer dissatisfaction about CCB regulatory measures, which could come with fines or loss of licensure, feel comfortable and confident emphasizing that there are laws that must be followed for the establishment to run legally. If you receive backlash or refusal to comply from a guest, alert your MOD as soon as possible.</p>

<h4>Understand that people have vastly different knowledge levels</h4>
<p>Be prepared to teach, and be prepared to learn. Since research in this field is still mostly in its infant stages, there isn't as much definitive information as there is about other substances: coffee, for example. If you have a disagreement with a customer, don't take it personally and research it later.</p>

<p>They also have very different tolerance levels. First-time users can have an overwhemling experience with the same amount of THC that a regular user might not even feel, particularly with edibles. And then there's everything in between. Try to determine their level of experience and tolerance as quickly as possible.</p>

<h4>Emotions are often an unexpected factor</h4>
<p>Many people who consume cannabis do so to alleviate some symptoms, even if they aren't card-carrying medical patients, so there is a certain level of vulnerability when consultations take place. Customers are also often opening up to you about how they're going to "get high", and considering the lingering stigma on cannabis use, this could be potentially nerve-wrack or embarrassing, and the customer might not even be aware of these emotions, they might just realize they feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p>A lot of consumers also still feel weird about buying weed at a store when some of them have spent sometimes decades hiding from law enforcement, and some of them have negative experiences even with law and possible jail time related to cannabis. Just possessing the weed still feels new, and a lot of people are still afraid to drive with it, even with the exit bag and the receipt and an unopened jar.</p>

<p>Also keep in mind that most dispensaries enterprise on variety, and often have an incredible number of things to choose from, which if you're still unfamiliar with cannabis, can be extremely daunting and overwhelming.</p> 

<p>Be as understanding as possible with guests and give them a little space. This isn't always easy; in my experience cannabis customers can be hard to handle because we're all still figuring out the industry. There are a lot of factors, especially in Nevada, that don't appear to be, from the customer's standpoint, in their best interests, and there is seemingly more agitation that occurs in this industry because of this.</p>

<h4>Be prepared to work with all walks of life.</h4>
<p>Cannabis doesn't really have a primary demographic because all walks of life use it, and in droves. In three consecutive transactions, you may sell to a middle-aged mother of three, a Vietnam war vet, and a girl celebrating her 21st birthday. Learn as much as you can from your customers, especially if they're out-of-state. This is especially important if you work in Las Vegas, because the terminology from weed has not homogenized yet, so different regions have different slang. "KD" for an eighth of and ounce is common on the East Coast, and a lot of long-time buyers use "zip" for an ounce. There are so many different regional terms to learn.</p>

<h4>Don't be afraid to sell expensive items</h4>
<p>You'll be surprised oftentimes who your big purchasers are. Sometimes unexpected people want to drop a pretty penny to have the quality they're looking for. Of course, don't push expensive items on people who express they're trying to save money, but until they ask for discounts, show them the best items. Like a restaurant server would recommend the prime rib, budtenders should feel comfortable recommending top-shelf products. And remember, you work in retail, so the amount of money you can bring in is a factor.</p>
