<h2 id="GLP">Green Life Productions</h2>

<img src="C:\Users\Trillian\OneDrive\Desktop\BT Training\Cultivator Logos\glp.png" alt="GLP Logo" class="logo" />

<p>Based in Pahrump, Nevada, Green Life Productions, or GLP, is known best for their organic, no-till-soil growing methods. Rather than use pesticides, they use preying mantises as pest control. They also use a network of mushrooms and their mycelium network to transfer nutrients throughout the soil.</p>

<h3>Most Popular Products</h3>
<p><strong>Organic Flower and Bottom Buds</strong> are this company's bread and butter, and are often dropped in small batches.</p>

<p><strong>Rosin</strong> is another popular product they make, solventless concentrate using only heat and pressure to extract cannabinoids and terpenes</p>

<p><strong>Baby J's</strong> are small. .3g prerolled joints that come in a cute little Altoids-type tin.</p>

<h2 id="Wyld">Wyld Gummies</h2>

<img src="C:\Users\Trillian\OneDrive\Desktop\BT Training\Cultivator Logos\wyld.jpg" alt="Wyld Logo" class="logo" />

<p>By far one of the most popular brands of gummies, they have a distinctly pleasant texture and relatively zero cannabis taste. They are also consistent in effect and their ratioed gummies, those that include CBD, CBN, CBC, or CBG, are also very effective. They're also known for their incredible taste and texture, completely concealing the potent taste of the plant. They are available and popular in several legal states and are a widely recognized brand.</p>

<h2 id="mmDev">Medizin, Trendi, Haha, and Dreamland</h2>


<img src="C:\Users\Trillian\OneDrive\Desktop\BT Training\Cultivator Logos\medizin.webp" alt="Medizin Logo" class="inline-image" />
<img src="C:\Users\Trillian\OneDrive\Desktop\BT Training\Cultivator Logos\trendi.png" alt="Trendi Logo" class="inline-image" />
<img src="C:\Users\Trillian\OneDrive\Desktop\BT Training\Cultivator Logos\haha.png" alt="Haha Logo" class="inline-image-square" />
<img src="C:\Users\Trillian\OneDrive\Desktop\BT Training\Cultivator Logos\dreamland.png" alt="Dreamland Logo" class="inline-image" />


<p>These are the major brands of the behemouth Planet 13. They also have a smaller local shop called Medizin. But they are, as to my knowledge, the largest dispensary in the world, and just added their consumption lounge that I believe just opened. They have many signature strains and mammoth production ability.</p>

<p><strong>Medizin Flower</strong> is the cornerstone, signature strains being Chloe, Irene, Mango Kush, and GG4. They also have concentrates, most notably their live resin. They also do cartridges and prerolls</p>

<p><strong>Trendi</strong> is their more experimental brand, coming out with different cross strains more often than Medizin focusing also on concetrates and vapes.</p>

<p><strong>Haha Gummies and Dreamland Chocolate</strong> are both made onsite and are the edible side of their product line.</p>

<h2 id="naturesChem">Nature's Chemistry</h2>

<img src="C:\Users\Trillian\OneDrive\Desktop\BT Training\Cultivator Logos\nature's chem.png" alt="Nature's Chem Logo" class="logo-large" />

<p>Nature's Chem is generally known for their high-potency flower and their high terpenes. They have great signature strains such as Ghost Train Haze, Blue Hash Plant, and Garlic Cookies. They also do infused prerolls and exclusive releases of particularly high THC strains. They are also known for their consistency, for you rarely see too much variance in potency between their strains.</p>

<h2 id="virtue">Virtue</h2>

<img src="C:\Users\Trillian\OneDrive\Desktop\BT Training\Cultivator Logos\virtue.webp" alt="Virtue Logo" class="logo-large" />

<p>Virtue is known for their premium, high-potency strains. Some of their most well-known are Diamond Dust, Private Reserve, XXX OG, and G13. Their flower has a reputation for being dense and covered in trichomes, their concentrates are often live rosins. They also do other concentrates, disposable vapes, and have a younger sister company called Vice which makes distillate vapes and tries out new cannabis strains in flower.</p>

<h2 id="stiiizy">Stiiizy</h2>

<img src="C:\Users\Trillian\OneDrive\Desktop\BT Training\Cultivator Logos\stiiizy.jpg" alt="Stiiizy Logo" class="logo-large" />

<p>Pronounced "steeezy", a portmanteau of "stylish" and "easy", they are probably most famous for their vapes, which come both in disposable form and in pods that connect to a proprietary battery. They are discreet and visually very dissimilar from typical 510 threaded battery-based vapes.</p>

<p>They also sometimes release flower, but more well-known are their hard-hitting gummies, their live rosin jam, and their Stiiizy 40's, which are highly potent infused prerolls that are covered in kief. In Nevada, they're the closest to the Cali-coveted Jeters. It's a very large company that has facilities in many legal states.</p>

<h2 id="fleur">Fleur</h2>

<img src="C:\Users\Trillian\OneDrive\Desktop\BT Training\Cultivator Logos\fleur.png" alt="Fleur Logo" class="logo-large" />

<p>One of the few organic, soil-grown cultivators in Nevada, Fleur is dedicate mostly to natural, Green Clean Certified, good-for-the-Earth and the consumer flower. A few of their notable strains are LA Confidential, Miss Africa, Angel Fire (a CBD-dominant strain), and Grape Monster. They also do prerolls that often come in a 0.6g weight that is usually ideal for one person.</p>

<h2 id="sips">Sip Elixirs</h2>

<img src="C:\Users\Trillian\OneDrive\Desktop\BT Training\Cultivator Logos\sips.png" alt="Sips Logo" class="logo-large" />

<p>A little fruity-tasting shot worth 100mg THC, these are favorites of high-dosage consumers who don't necessarily want to eat 10 gummies or a whole chocolate bar. They often come out with new products and new flavors, and are usually markedly inexpensive. They're easy to consume and compact in packaging, but new users proceed with caution. Half a capful is one regular dose.</p>
