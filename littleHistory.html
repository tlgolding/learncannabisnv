<h1>A Brief History of Cannabis</h1>
<p>Going back to ancient time, cannabis has been used by humans for tens of thousands of years. It was one of the first plants ever cultivated deliberately ("Sativa" in Latin means "Cultivated". "Indica" comes from "India", the region when the Western world rediscovered it in India around the French Revolution), and helped spark the Agricultural Revolution, and was quintessential to many ancient cultures:</p>

<h2>Cannabis in the Ancient World</h2>

<p>Cannabis has a rich and intertwined history with humankind dating back to 38,000 BC. Its usefulness in creating textiles, its medicinal properties, and even its psychoactive effects made it an important part of many ancient cultures. Archaeological evidence like hemp rope, residues on altars, and even cannabis pollen found with Pharaoh Ramses II, showcases its prevalence across Eurasia.</p>

<h2 id="scripture">Cannabis in Scripture</h2>

<p>The Hebrew word "Kaneh-bosen", often interpreted as a different plant, is theorized by some to actually refer to cannabis. This, combined with known historical cannabis use at the time, suggests its presence in Biblical stories. The high concentration of "Kaneh-bosen" in Moses' holy anointing oil aligns with the known medicinal effects of cannabis. The account of Moses and the burning bush, along with Jesus's use of a similar oil to heal ailments treatable with cannabis, further support this theory.</p>

<p>Whether or not cannabis is definitively the plant referenced in the Bible, its potential presence highlights its long history of medicinal and, to some, spiritual applications.  This offers new perspectives on Biblical narratives and strengthens the argument for the plant's significance in ancient times.  The fact that cannabis was so widely used across many cultures speaks to its versatility and supports its ongoing investigation for modern therapeutic purposes.</p>

<h2 id="china">Ancient China</h2>

<p>Ancient China held cannabis in high regard, recognizing its immense value for practical and medicinal applications. From its fibers, they crafted textiles, ropes, and importantly, paper – a transformative invention. Cannabis roots, stems, flowers, and seeds all found purpose within their culture, whether for healing remedies, offerings, or food sources.</p>

<p>Chinese medicine deeply intertwined with cannabis. Emperor Fu Hsi's early acknowledgement set the foundation, and by 100 AD, its use extended to over a hundred ailments. Its role in restoring the balance of yin and yang reflects their understanding of the plant's therapeutic properties. The legendary Shen Nung, the Father of Chinese Medicine, experimented extensively with cannabis, citing its effectiveness for conditions ranging from pain and menstrual problems to absent-mindedness. His life, dedicated to herbal exploration, highlights the reverence held for plant-based remedies.</p>

<p>Cannabis played a role in trade and cultural exchange. Its prevalence along the Silk Road facilitated the spread of knowledge and the plant itself. However, changing philosophical currents like Taoism, with its emphasis on abstinence, led to a decrease in usage. Despite this shift, individuals like Hua T'o, who pioneered the use of cannabis for surgical anesthesia, affirmed the continued recognition of its medicinal value.</p>

<h2 id="hindu">Ancient Hinduism</h2>

<p>Cannabis holds a profound place within the fabric of Hinduism and Indian culture. Revered as a sacred plant, its origins are intertwined with divine legends like that of Shiva, who embraced cannabis after seeking refuge under its leaves. This connection is reflected in the ancient Atharva-veda texts, where cannabis is hailed as a gift from the gods, capable of healing and connecting mortals with the divine.</p>

<p>Bhang, the traditional cannabis-infused drink, exemplifies this enduring relationship. Its preparation and consumption have persisted through centuries,  used in religious festivals and daily life for its perceived benefits to health, spirituality, and overall well-being.  Some believe it reflects the legend of Shiva, who, according to stories, discovered and favored the plant for its rejuvenating properties.</p>

<p>Ancient India possessed a sophisticated understanding of cannabis consumption. While bhang offered a milder, gradual experience, techniques existed to produce higher potencies. Ganja, similar to dried flower, and charas, a potent resin concentrate, demonstrate their knowledge of extracting and concentrating the plant's active compounds.</p>

<p>The deep integration of cannabis into Hindu scriptures like the Atharva-veda highlights its religious significance. Passages describe cannabis as a divine manifestation, associated with the powerful god Soma and believed to facilitate spiritual connection. Such beliefs have solidified cannabis as an intrinsic part of Indian life, despite attempts to suppress its use. This enduring legacy underscores the plant's potential for both physical and spiritual applications, making it a fascinating subject for further exploration in the context of ancient cultures.</p>

<a href="#goToTop">Back to Top</a>

<h2 id="egypt">Ancient Egypt</h2>

<p>Ancient Egypt's relationship with cannabis, while still subject to some interpretation, reveals a significant understanding of the plant's potential. Evidence like cannabis pollen found with Ramses II and references to "shemshemet" in various papyri suggest its use for various medicinal purposes.</p>

<p>Healers harnessed cannabis for a wide range of ailments, including eye problems like glaucoma, painful conditions like hemorrhoids, menstrual issues, and even potentially cancerous tumors. Recipes found in texts like the Ebers Papyrus detail various applications, from topical treatments to vaginal insertions.  Some depictions of deities like Sheshat and Bastet, with symbols associated with cannabis and hemp, further suggest a cultural and possibly spiritual connection to the plant.</p>

<p>While our knowledge of Ancient Egypt is continuously evolving with ongoing translation of papyri, the available evidence strongly implies that cannabis held a place in their healing practices. They employed creative methods to administer its benefits, mirroring the experimental spirit seen in other early civilizations that encountered cannabis.</p>

<p>Despite its presence, the role of cannabis in Ancient Egypt seems less pervasive compared to cultures like that of China and India. Nonetheless, their understanding of its medicinal properties contributes to the rich history of humankind's relationship with this versatile plant.</p>

<h2 id="greece">Ancient Greece and Rome</h2>

<p>Ancient Greece and Rome embraced cannabis as another intoxicant, though it never became a cornerstone of their society. Introduced through contact with nomadic tribes, its use was primarily recreational and spiritual. Unlike other cultures, written records suggest instances of casual consumption for enjoyment, marking an early shift toward social smoking.  Medically, they used cannabis for conditions like earaches, swelling, pain, and interestingly, to suppress sexual desire.</p>

<p>Spiritual practices involved burning cannabis alongside other aromatics to create a fragrant, intoxicating smoke. They believed this altered state facilitated a connection with the divine and promoted communal bonding.  While not as deeply embedded as in other cultures, Greece and Rome played a role in the spread of cannabis across the ancient world through trade routes like the Silk Road. Their documentation of the Scythians, major proponents of cannabis, sheds further light on its historical journey across Europe. </p>

<a href="#goToTop">Back to Top</a>

<h2 id="scythians">The Scythians and the Thracians</h2>

<p>The Scythians and Thracians, though often overlooked in mainstream history, played a pivotal role in shaping the ancient world's relationship with cannabis. From the 7th to the 1st centuries BCE, the nomadic Scythians dominated Eurasia, expertly traversing the trade routes that would become crucial to the spread of cannabis. Their rituals, like the Cult of the Dead ceremonies involving cannabis smoke, demonstrated both spiritual and recreational applications of the plant. They embodied a fierce, matriarchal society where cannabis held a sacred place in their understanding of life, death, and the divine.</p>

<p>In contrast, the fair-skinned Thracians were renowned for their healing practices and exceptional skill in weaving hemp fibers into fine textiles. Their connection to cannabis was gentler, showcasing the plant's medicinal potential and practical versatility. Associated with the god Dionysus, their rituals likely involved cannabis alongside other intoxicants.</p>

<p>The influence of these two tribes cannot be overstated. The Scythians, as masters of trade routes, facilitated the dissemination of cannabis across vast distances.  Their unique burial practices and spiritual use of cannabis left an enduring mark on how cultures viewed its properties.  Simultaneously, the Thracians, through their craftsmanship and potential influence on Greek mythology, emphasized the practical and multifaceted nature of the plant.  </p>

<p>While their stories might be less familiar, the Scythians and Thracians remind us of the profound historical journey of cannabis. Their distinct uses highlight its adaptability and the ways diverse cultures have embraced this remarkable plant throughout time.</p>

<h2 id="europe">Cannabis Arrives In Europe</h2>

<p>Cannabis firmly established its European presence during the rise of Arab trade and the dawn of maritime exploration. Ironically, the very plant that facilitated European colonialism through the creation of durable hemp sails also became a source of cultural exchange and controversy. </p>

<p>Russia, with its early exposure to cannabis but limited growing potential, became a major hemp supplier to Britain's powerful navy. This dependence highlighted the strategic importance of the plant for practical purposes. Meanwhile, early attempts at restriction surfaced, such as Spain's ban on recreational cannabis use in the Americas, foreshadowing the divide between "useful" hemp and "intoxicating" cannabis.</p>

<p>Italy embraced the revolution of hemp sails, accelerating European maritime dominance and demonstrating the integral role cannabis played in global trade expansion.  Napoleon's conquests in India brought hashish, a concentrated form of cannabis, back to France.  Its popularity among French soldiers and later with the artistic Le Club de Hachichins challenged early attempts at prohibition, revealing the allure of its effects within influential circles.</p>

<p>The War of 1812 further entangled the fate of cannabis with international conflict.  Napoleon's attempted hemp embargo on Britain, and Britain's reliance on American hemp supplies, highlight the plant's power within geopolitical struggles.</p>

<p>This period marks a significant shift in the European relationship with cannabis. While its practical value in textiles and trade was undeniable, its recreational and mind-altering properties sparked both fascination and fear, setting the stage for future debates and regulations. </p>

<a href="#goToTop">Back to Top</a>

<h2 id="britain">Britain's Special Love For Cannabis</h2>

<p>Britain's reliance on cannabis was multifaceted. King Henry VIII's mandates and Queen Elizabeth I's strict enforcement ensured a steady hemp supply for the powerful British navy, underscoring its strategic importance.  Meanwhile, evidence such as Shakespeare's pipes and suggestive sonnets hint at potential recreational use, even among cultural icons.</p>

<p>Medicinally, Britain harnessed cannabis tinctures for conditions ranging from menstrual cramps to convulsions. Figures like William O'Shaughnessy, inspired by Indian practices, and Sir Robert Russell, who conducted early clinical trials, championed its therapeutic potential. Queen Victoria's rumored use for menstrual pain further demonstrates its integration into even the highest levels of society.</p> 

<p>Britain's colonial reach extended cannabis cultivation to Australia, where it thrived as a cash crop. This period reflects a time when cannabis was deeply woven into the fabric of British life, serving practical, medicinal, and potentially even recreational purposes.</p>

<p>This emphasizes the significant, yet often overlooked, impact of cannabis on British history. Its importance in maritime power and medicine contrasts with the eventual suppression of knowledge about its uses. This historical omission likely contributed to later negative perceptions of cannabis in the 20th century.</p>

<a href="#goToTop">Back to Top</a>

<h2 id="africa">Early Cannabis in Africa</h2>

<p>The Democratic Republic of Congo, Europeans discovered in the early 19th century, the Bashilange tribe had found and used cannabis, and had made it a pillar of their culture. Formerly a vicious, combative, cannibalistic tribe, the cannabis had changed everything. They had dubbed themselves the “Sons of Cannabis” and passed laws to promote love and friendship. They stopped cannibalizing and banned weapons, as well as increasing sexual activity and encouraging cannabis smoking to come together as a community.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as is often true when a society, however small, tries to enact practices based in peace and love, they were hated and their rulers killed, turning them back into the tribe they used to be. Pressure and action from other tribes, which was common at the time and really the only way to survive, as unfamiliar as it may be to us, but for one shining moment the cannabis plant encouraged peace.</p>

<a href="#goToTop">Back to Top</a>

<h2 id="earlyUS">The US Prior to the 1900s</h2>

<p>Cannabis played a vital role in shaping early America. Introduced by French settlers and quickly recognized for its versatility, it became a mandatory crop, its fibers essential for everything from sails to the very documents upon which the nation was founded. Even figures like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson cultivated cannabis, reflecting its widespread acceptance. The US gained a strategic advantage during the Revolutionary War by producing its own durable hemp sails, outpacing Britain's reliance on imports.</p>

<p>Cannabis held medicinal significance as well. Added to the US pharmacopeia in 1850, it was used to treat a vast array of ailments, demonstrating its perceived value as a near-universal remedy. Even religious groups like the early Mormon Church embraced hemp cultivation as a path to self-sufficiency.</p>

<p>This positive relationship began to shift with the influx of Mexican refugees following the Mexican Revolution of 1910. Anti-immigrant sentiments and fear of social upheaval became intertwined with cannabis, its association with Mexican culture fueling a backlash.  This marked a turning point, laying the groundwork for the eventual demonization and criminalization of the plant in the 20th century.</p>

<p>Despite this impending change, the history of cannabis in the US is one of profound influence. It fueled maritime power, aided healing, and even inspired religious practices. Its deep roots in American society highlight a stark contrast with the negative perceptions that would later take hold.</p>
