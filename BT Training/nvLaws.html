<h1>Nevada Laws and Regulations</h1>
<p>This will be a small summary of some key things to remember, but it's best to familiarize yourself with the CCB website, which has all the official laws and regulations. <a href="https://ccb.nv.gov/laws-regulations/" target="_blank">Click here to open the CCB's website</a></p>

<h3>Cash Only</h3>
<p>Because cannabis is federally illegal, no actual debit card or credit card transactions can take place in Nevada. Some dispensaries use cashless ATMs at the registers to make it more convenient for guests, but those are still technically ATM machines, and are subject to ATM fees, as well as round-ups with cash back as change, since ATMs go in 5-20 dollar increments. They are also subject to ATM daily withdrawal limits, so, for example, if your guest is visiting Vegas and earlier that day withdrew $1000 and hit their max, they will not be able to use their debit card at the cashless ATM.</p>

<p><em>For these reasons, being prepared with cash for cannabis purchases is always best practice, for now.</em></p>

<h3>Maximum Purchase Laws</h3>
<p>In Nevada, the maximum possession amount is 2.5 ounces of flower, or 8 grams of concentrates or vapes. Edibles get kind of a pass, as their package max is 100mg, and 8 grams comes to 800mg, allowing customers to "max out" to nearly 80 packs of 100mg edibles.</p>

<h3>Exit Bags</h3>
<p>Some dispensaries charge for Exit Bags, some do not. The sealed exit bag is required for all legal purchases, and must remain sealed on all dispensary property. It's best to remind guests not to open thei bags before they leave the property.</p>

<h3>Receipts and Labels</h3>
<p>The CCB also requires all cannabis products to leave the store with a receipt and the GK-420 labels, or testing labels, for each cannabis product being purchased/taken out of the store, including rewards and promotional itmes.</p>

<h3>No Free Items</h3>
<p>All items must leave the store being rung up at at least one penny. Dispensaries normally round down or eat the few cents.</p>

<h3>No Returns (For the Most Part)</h3>
<p>While some companies do have policies to allow for returns or replacement products, in general, all cannabis sales in Nevada are final.</p>

<h3>Discounts</h3>
<p>Again, some dispensaries stack discounts, but in general to keep the tracking as simple as possible, many dispensaries will not "stack" discounts, meaning they will pick the best available discount for each item, rather that using all available discounts. There are exceptions to this</p>

<h3>Public Consumption</h3>
<p>Legally, only private residences. Anywhere that a lease or contract or ownership is involved. Technically this does exclude any public spaces, including hotel rooms and city streets.</p>

<h3>State Lines</h3>
<p>Transport over state lines is a federal matter, and cannabis is federally illegal, so any transport over state lines is illegal, regardless of the legality in the state being traveled to.</p>
