<h1>Strain Lineage</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>All cannabis strains owe their lineage to several strains that were grown early on by people who brought the plant to different regions, where the different climates caused the cannabis to take on different qualities, such as effects, potency, and terpene profile, which dictates the aroma. These are called Landrace Strains, or Landrace Sativas, even though some are incicas, all "sativa" really means is "cultivated", referring to the original plants that were taken and cultivated in different places.</p>

<h2>Origin of Cannabis</h2>
<p>Cannabis was initially found on the Eastern Tibetan Plateau, growing wild, around 38,000 BC. People quickly cultivated it, bringing it to a few places across the globe where it grew proliferously, and slowly began to be brought to more and more places. This was before we started using our knowledge of horiculture to start creating hybrid strains by crossing two Landrace strains using various methods, such as hand pollination.</p>

<p>Now, so much cross breeding of strains has occured that most strains fall into the Hybrid category, and are a blend of many generations of selective breeding and choosing of phenotypes.</p>

<h4>Note about Sativa vs. Indica vs. Hybrid:</h4>
<p>These terms have come to be used interchangably with their effect, and sometimes are even determined by terpenes. While terpenes can enhance the effect of a strain, they cannot "turn" an Indica into a Sativa. And though the strains that traditionally fall under the "Indica" and "Sativa" types do have similar effects, they are technically the same plant, just grown for generations under different climates, and now they are strains bred from other strains in highly controlled and standardized climates.</p>

<p>Personally, I try not to get attached to these terms, and rather experiment to find which strain families I tend to like to make consumption decisions. Just like the entourage effect, using a combination of terpenes and cannabinoid to make the experience more holistic, use a mixture of strain knowledge, terpene knowledge, and knowledge of cannabinoids to guide purchasing decisions. The conviction that all Indicas or Sativas will produce a certain effect, and the idea that a certain terpene will always affect you a certain way, unless a genuine allergy is present, is generally a limited way of selecting strains and may keep you from finding ones you really enjoy.</p>

<h2>Landrace Strains</h2>
<p>We don't have all the landrace strains, but I've compiled all the ones I can find information on and created a list.</p>

<h3>Afghani</h3>
<p>Location: India</p>
<p>Was perfected to create the best hash, such as charas, and the seeds were made available by a company in the Netherlands. Is considered an indica because of the mountainous region it was cultivated in.</p>

<h3>Hindu Kush</h3>
<p>Location: Pakistani-Afghani Mountain Range, India</p>
<p>From the same mountain range as the Afghani. Known for its soothing, sedative effects.</p>

<h3>Colombian Gold</h3>
<p>Location: Santa Marta Mountains, Colombia</p>
<p>Instrumental in many hybrid strains, as it is one of the parents of Skunk #1, one of the first known crossbred strains. Energized and creative effects without paranoia.</p>

<h3>Acapulco Gold</h3>
<p>Location: Acapulco, Mexico</p>
<p>One of the most beloved landrace strains, it was known for its orange hairs and toffee-like scent. It is becoming increasingly hard to find as THC levels drop through dilution.</p>

<h3>Thai or Thai Stick</h3>
<p>Location: Thailand</p>
<p>One of the parents of the famous Haze strain family, this strain was first brought to the states during the 1970's and 80's, when soldiers would bring seeds home with them.</p>

<h3>Nepalese Kush</h3>
<p>Location: Himalayan Mountain Range, Nepal</p>
<p>A great example of the discrepancy between Indica and Sativa, this strain's plant structure is more like a traditonal "Sativa" plant, the effects and the density of the buds tend to have more "Indica" qualities. In Nevada, one cultivator who often grows this strain is Matrix NV.</p>

<h3>Aceh or Atjah</h3>
<p>Location: Indonesia</p>
<p>This is an energetic, uplifting strain generally, it grows thin and tall, and is one of the finest strains to come from this region.</p>

<h3>Swazi Gold</h3>
<p>Location: Swaziland, Africa</p>
<p>A hearty strain from a rough mountain climate, Swazi tends to grow extremely heartily due to its native conditions, making it a swift and powerful effect, but an extremely long wait time for the cultivator (55-85 days to harvest).</p>

<h3>Lamb's Bread</h3>
<p>Location: Jamaica</p>
<p>Also known as Lamb's Breath, the origins of this strain are somewhat unknown, it's just known that it was grown and cultivated in Jamaica. It's famous for it's pungent, slightly cheesy, sweet-spicy scent.</p>

<h3>Durban Poison</h3>
<p>Location: Durban, South Africa</p>
<p>Durban, a port city in South Africa, is the home of this famous strain, known for its uplifting, energizing effects and sweet smell. Some cultivators in Nevada still regularly grow this strain, such as Remedy</p>

<h3>Sheberghan Hash Plant</h3>
<p>Location: Afghanistan</p>
<p>Has a wide potency range, and sometimes plants are even high in CBD, depending on the genetic phenotype. Buds are dense and resinous and good for extraction.</p>

<h3>Mag</h3>
<p>Location:Iran</p>
<p>Still grown in Illinois, this elusive landrace is famous for its vivid orange and purple speckles.</p>

<h3>Puna Buddaz</h3>
<p>Location: Hawaii</p>
<p>A very strong strain known for its psychedelic effects and high potency. From the Puna District of the Big Island, it has been grown and cultivated there for many years. It is not for the faint of heart!</p>

<h3>Moloka'i Purps</h3>
<p>Location: Moloka'i, Hawaii</p>
<p>A rich, sweet, berry-scented strain known for its sweetnes, some say it "smells purple", and has relaxing, soothing effects.</p>

<h2 id="crossStrains">Notable Cross Strains</h2>

<h3>Girl Scout Cookies</h3>
<p>Location: Southern California</p>
<p>Parents: OG Kush and Chemdawg</p>
<p>The winner of numerous awards, including the cannabis cup, GSC is probably the most well-known Hybrid strain, creating both an uplifting effect as well as a full-body high. Created by cultivator Jai and rapper Berner, they have now created an absolute empire with multiple now-reputable strains and a highly recognizable merchandise and clothing line.</p>
<p>Definitely read up more on Cookies and their story, <a href="https://cookies.co/about-us/" target="_blank">here</a> at their website.</p>

<h3>Blue Dream</h3>
<p>Location: California</p>
<p>Parents: Blueberry Kush and Haze</p>
<p>Famously high in Myrcene, despite being a Sativa-leaning Hybrid, this strain is highly favored by medical patients due to its effective pain relief effects. This is also widely used for gym-goers, as it provides a soothing body high and reduces inflammation, but is also not a sleepy Indica strain that would normally have those properties. It still has an uplifting effect.</p>

<h3>Jack Herer</h3>
<p>Location: Netherlands</p>
<p>Parents: Haze, Northern Lights #5, and Shiva Skunk</p>
<p>A famous Sativa-Hybrid, it was named for Jack Herer, who was a famous cannabis activist very early on and had a lot of influence on the cannabis community and legalization.</p>
<p>Actually, a short trip to Jack Herer's Wikipedia page wouldn't hurt. He is also a great name to know if you're working or active in cannabis.</p>

<h3>Skunk #1</h3>
<p>Location: Denver, Colorado (I think)</p>
<p>Parents: Afghani, Acapulco Gold, Colombian Gold</p>
<p>The cornerstone of the Hybrid cannabis landscape, it is the first known cross strain, and became wildly popular in the 1970's. It was painstakingly researched and bred by the Sacred Seed Co to have the best qualities of some of the best landraces they could find.</p>

<h3>Charlotte's Web</h3>
<p>Location: Colorado</p>
<p>Parents: I could not find the exact strains, but it was a regular THC plant bred with an industrial Hemp plant</p>
<p>This is an interesting strain because it was bred specifically for medicinal purposes for children, and contains almost no THC, instead focusing on gaining as high CBD levels as possible. It was named for a little girl named Charlotte, who was one of the first children to receive the treatment for her rare seizure condition.</p>

<p>The story is actually quite nice, so I'm going to leave another Wikipedia article for you to read if you like.</p>

<h4>This is barely scratching the surface of all the different hybrid families; we didn't really get to discuss Hazes, Cake and Ice Cream Strains, Fruity strains, or Diesel and Octane strains. This is a decent start, however.</h4>
