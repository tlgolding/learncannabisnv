    <h1>How Many Milligrams?</h1>

    <h2>Calculating How Many Millgrams Have Been Consumed</h2>

    <p>Sometimes it's good to know how many milligrams you're consuming of cannabis, because it makes it easier to gauge your tolerance level. Some methods are easy, like edibles and RSO, but some are a little more complicated to figure out.</p>

    <h2>Edibles</h2>

    <p>Itâ€™s easy to calculate the dosage of someone consuming legal cannabis in edible form, considering the doses are written in milligrams.


    <h2>Flower</h2>

    If you have 3.5g of 25% THC flower:

    <p>25% x 3.5g = .87g x 10 = 87mg THC total</p>
    <br>

    <p>Another way to find out how many milligrams is being consumed is to reduce or multiply it to 1g.</p>

    <p>For example:</p>

    <p>1g preroll at 25% THC = .25g per g THC = 25mg THC</p>

    <p>Multiply %THC by .01 to get amount of THC per gram and multiply by total amount</p>

    <p>1g preroll at 20% THC = .2g per g THC = 20mg THC total</p>
    <br>

    <p>Another example:</p>

    <p>3.5g flower at 32% THC = .32g per g THC = 32mg/g(3.5g) = 112mg THC total</p>

    <h2>Concentrates</h2>

    <p>This works for concentrates, also:</p>

    <p>.1g dab at 75% = .75g per g THC = 7.5mg THC</p>

    <p>.25g dab at 80% = .8g per g THC(2.5) = 17mg THC</p>
    <br>

    <p>In essence:</p>

    <p>[(%THC).01]grams consumed x 10 = mg consumed</p>

    <p>Reducing it to mg/g simply makes it easier to decide how much has been smoked</p>

    <h3>For Example:</h3>

    <p>7g of 15% THC cannabis is consumed in one night between 5 friends, who all smoke more or less the same amount. About how many milligrams did they each consume?</p>

    <p>15%THC = .15gTHC per gram = 1.05 g THC total = 105mg = about 17.5mg each</p>
    <br>

    <p>Or:</p>

    <p>3 friends share a preroll at 32% THC, more or less equally. How many milligrams did each of them consume?</p>

    <p>32%THC = .32gTHC per gram = 32mg THC total = about 10.6mg each</p>

    <h2>Concentrates</h2>

    <p>Although easier to convert to mg of THC, concentrates have an extra step because they need to be divided into individual dabs once you figure out how much is in each gram. For example:</p>

    <p>You take a .1g dab of some 90% crystalline. How much THC did you consume?</p>

    <p>90%THC = .9gTHC per gram = 90mg THC total/10 = 9mg per .1g dab</p>
    <br>

    <p>Or, you get an oddly proportioned .23g dab of the crystalline. How much THC then?</p>

    <p>90%THC = .9gTHC per gram(.23) = .189g, or 18.9mg in that dab.</p>
    <br>

    <p>What about a .25g dab of 77% badder. How much THC?</p>

    <p>77%THC = .77THC per gram = 77mg THC total/4 = 19.25 mg in your dab</p>

    <h2>Milligram Effect By Type and Tolerance</h2>

    <p>Generally, though the THC mg might be similar, some people are affected more by certain types. In Nevada, 10mg is considered a full dose, but consumers with higher tolerances may have no effect from this amount. The curve on cannabis tolerance is exponential, meaning once you get used to 100mg, you'll be okay with 500mg, and then I personally have heard doses in one sitting of 2k+mg. I, of course, do not recommend this as it seems to be surpassing enjoying the plant and its effects.</p>

    <p>Lots of people report that concentrate usage was a catalyst in increasing tolerance, the "giant dab" trend of the 2010s not helping that at all. The more you use, the more you will need. If you are a Budtender be very mindful of the user's current frequency of use (not what they used to consume), as this seems to be the biggest factor of tolerance.</p>

    <p>Budtending, especially as it pertains to Nevada and Las Vegas, has a heavy emphasis on getting to know the sweeping range of customer tolerance. Always take special precaution with first-time and relatively new users. This is why, among many veteran users,  flower is considered the superior method of consumption, despite the negative effects of smoke, because consumption of THC itself is mechanically slowed down. This creates a more consistent and slow-moving high than concentrates or vape pens.</p>
