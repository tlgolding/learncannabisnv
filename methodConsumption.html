<h1>Methods Of Consumption</h1>

<h2>Flower/Bud</h2>
<h3>The most popular way of smoking</h3>
<p>Most consumers prefer to buy buds and prepare them their own preferred way, such as a bong, a pipe, a joint, blunt, or even baking it themselves. Normally, when a customer comes in and asks a nonspecific question - e.g. "What's good"? - they are looking for flower, most likely in an eighth or a gram.</p>

<h2>Prerolls</h2>
<h3>For the customer who values convenience</h3>
<p>A large portion of customers actually prefer prerolls, because they don't have to deal with the flower, which can be messy and smelly, and because rolling isn't the easiest thing in the world. If you can, you can, but if you can't, sometimes it's nice to just have a preroll.</p>

<p>There are also <strong>infused prerolls</strong>, which have concentrates rolled into the flower, usually shatter or crumble, bust sometimes distillate or live resin. These are good for hgih-tolerance consumers who don't feel they get high from regular prerolls.</p>

<p>If you have a new customer, or if the customer asks if the prerolls burn well, advise them to light the preroll without inhaling, until the full ring arond the edge is burning, a.k.a. you want a ring of fire before you inhale. The inhale and light the front again if necessary. If you light a preroll rawdog while breathing in, it will 100% canoe, so make sure the preroll is being lit properly.</p>


<h2>Edibles</h2>
<h3>The most accessible form of consumption</h3>
<p>In Nevada, the maximum dose for edibles is 10mg per serving, and 100 mg per package. For example, most people will buy a bag of 10 gummies of 10mg of THC. This is actually perfect dosage for beginning users. which if you work in Nevada it's likely you work with tourists, who are more likeloy to be new users. 10mg is a full dose for non-daily consumers. 5mg is often perfectly sufficient for people who seldom use. And for people who are really nervous, 2.5mg with some CBD thrown in there is perfectly sufficient. There are other options for high-dose consumers.</p>

<h3>Edibles include drinks, also.</h3>
<p>Notably, Sips Elixirs has a 100mg shot that can be dosed by 5mg per the cap, and there are other liquid options, such as CannaPunch, which works a bit more like a cough syrup. There are also a host of drinks that are low-dose, such as Haha sodas and CANN waters.</p>


<h2>Vaporizers</h2>
<h3>Fast-acting discretion</h3>
<p><strong>Disposables</strong> have both the oil and the battery in one, Usually the oil is distillate, but some companies do Live Resin or even Rosin disposables. There are lots of different sizes of dsposables, going from .3g to a full 2g.</p>

<p><strong>Cartridges</strong> usually refer to replacable oil vessels that fit 5-10 batteries, which is the most standard abattery, and if it's a twist-on battery, there's a 95% chance it's this type of battery. They usually come in .5g-1g sizes.</p>

<p><strong>Pods</strong> are usually proprietary cartridges that only fit one battery only available for one cultivator, and sometimes have other advantages, such as temperature control, hit count, and locking features.</p>


<h2>Concentrates</h2>
<h3>Dabbin'</h3>
<p>Okay...Dab people often KNOW about dabs, so I'm going to include a couple videos about the different types of dabs there are, because it's very involved.</p>

<h2>Tinctures and RSOs</h2>
<h3>As high-dose as possible</h3>
<p><strong>Tinctures</strong> are extractions that can go up to about 750-800mg THC with some companies offering ratioes of other cannnabinoids. They are taken in small doses and are considered more therapeutic. A scaled dropper will allow the user to drop a measured dose of THC underneath their tongue, where there are a plethora of blood vessels waiting to absorbs the cannabinoids in the tincture for almost-immediate absorption</p>

<p><strong>RSO stands for Rick Simpson Oil</strong>, referring to the man that created the modern process for using ethanol and time to extract the cannabinoids from the plant, resulting in a thick, gel-like product that can e ingested in small amounts for therapeutic use, most popularly in food.</p>

<p><strong>Tablets</strong> are often pressed pills or even <strong>capsules</strong> infused with cannabis. These are extremely discreet, portable, and some products, like IndoTabs, contain other supplements like B-vitamins and magnesium.</p>


<h2>Other Methods</h2>
<h3>Topicals</h3>
<p>Usually available in lotions and someimtes gels or patches, topicals are a great way to relieve pain wihtout getting high. They are good for muscle pain and nerve pain, and I have personally used it for menstrual and ovarian pain.</p>
