<h1>Cannabinoids and the Endocannabinoid System</h1>

<p>To start, we all have an endocannabinoid system that is partially responsible for homeostasis, which is the general harmony between body systems. We produce our own endocannabinoid, called anandamide, and tetrahydrocannabinol is the correct structure to replace and enhance these endocannadinoids. Endocannabinoids come from our mothers' breast milk, and at first teach the baby how to get hungry, much the way THC has a side effect of increased appaetite. Endocannabinoids are essential to our thriving when life begins.</p>

<h2>The Endocannabinoid System</h2>

<p>Our bodies have receptors that naturally absorb and process cannabinoids, CB1 receptors that are in the central nervous system, and CB2 receptors that are in the periphery, in other parts of the body. They help regulate physiological processes.</p>

<p>The endcocnnabinoid system includes the actual endocannabinoids that are at play, the enzymes that are responsible for processing the (endo)cannabinoids, and the receptors. Endocannabinoids, studies have shown, act as neuromodulators.</p>

<p>Side note: This is possibly part of the reason that certain mental illnesses are not conducive to the use of cannabinoids, because the pathways are divergent, so THC actually can interrupt homeostasis and regulation. For example, cannabis is explicitly not reommended for those experiencing schizophrenia or psychosis.</p>

<p>The cannabinoid system is vastly complicated, and this is just a beginning foray into what this system is capable of and how important it can be.</p>

<h2>Cannabinoids</h2>

<h3 id="anandamide">Anandamide</h3>

<p>To begin, we have the endocannabinoid that we produce naturally. It is a fatty acid neurotrasnmitter, so helps our brains send messages to our bodies. It binds to cannabinoid receptors, of which we naturally have two types, the same receptors that are activated by THC.</p>

<p>As stated earlier, anandamide has an integral role in our bodies' early development. In starts before breatsfeeding, however, as peak plasma anandamide happens during ovulation and works together with other hormones (estradiol and gonadotrophin) to assist fertility. A lack of anandamide in the system actually can indicate infertility</p>

<h3 id="thc">Tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta-9 THC)</h3>

<p>The primary psychoactive compound in cannabis, THC is responsible for the "high" feeling. It is structurally similar enough to anandamide that it can replace it in many cases, for those who are endocannabinoid-deficient. It is unique amongst "controlled substances" in that the median lethal dose is not actually known. Wives' tales say that if you try to smoke yourself to death on cannabis that you'll die of carbon monozide poinsoning before you overdose on THC (please do not try this).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the history of cannabis' illegality has inhibited most research efforts on what this compund actually does in the frame of what medical science is capable of now, but that is changing. Particularly with the advent of cannabis recently getting rescheduled from a Schedule 1 drug (on par with meth and heroine) to being a Schedule 3 drug (included with ketamine and anabolic steroids), it should be easier in the future for scientists to conduct more meaningful studies on how THC affects us as a whole population, leaving less guesswork for consumers.</p>

<h3 id="cbd">Cannabidiol (CBD)</h3>

<p>CBD is most famous for its therapeutic properties, known for its ability to ease anxiety, pain, inflammation, and increase the general experience of medicinal/therapeutic THC through something called the entourage or ensemble effect. What this means is that THC opens the blood-brain barrier and allows for the absorption of other cannabinoids, making THC and CBD "partners in crime" that helps each other get the job done.</p>

<p>Since CBD can be more legally produced, there has been more research done on it. Most states allow hemp-derived CBD, so long as the substance contains less that 0.1% THC. Minimal THC is needed to produce the entourage effect. CBD does not have the same effects as THC, and can actually help regulate the effects of THC. For example, if a friend has over-medicated on THC and is having anxiety issues, (remember THC does increase your heart rate) a tincture or vape of pure CBD can help inhibit further absorption of THC, preventing further spiraling. (I recommend tincture and vape because they have the fastest activation time) This is not proven, of course, just something that some people have experienced.</p>

<p>CBD is quite safe, and if children with certain chronic illnesses are prescribed medicinal cannabis, or if dog owners want to use it for their pets, CBD is generally considered safe enough for both. Also, for people who are nervous about cannabis use, I found it was good to recommend ratioed products, such as gummies that contained equal amounts of THC and CBD (1:1), or sometimes more CBD than THC (2:1, 3:1), because the CBD will temper the effects of the THC without removing them.</p>

<h3 id="cbn">Cannabinol (CBN)</h3>

<p>Cannabinol is slightly psychoactive, and is generally known for its "sleep" effects. It is slightly psychoactive because it takes greater doses to experience those effects. It is often used in indica-heavy edibles to increase their sedative effect. It was actually discovered relatively early, in 1896 by Thomas Barlow, and the structure was first identified in the 1930s by Robert Sydney Cain (just before the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937), and became the first development of a cannabis extract.</p>

<p>CBN is interesting because the continued oxidation of THC will create the CBN, so the longer cannabis sits around, the more opportunity there is for THC to hydroxylize into CBN.</p>

<a href="#goToTop">Back to Top</a>

<h3 id="cbg">Cannabigerol (CBG)</h3>

<p>Sometimes called "the mother of all cannabinoids", CBG is unique in that it is the starting cannabinoid that others develop into. Young cannabis plants are usually richer in CBG, but once the plant is ripe, there is often very little left. Think of CBG as the "stem cells" of cannabinoids.</p>

<p>CBG is generally experienced to be an appetite stimulant, similar to THC, and is sometimes said to improve gut health. In my personal experience, CBG feels happy and giggly, but doesn't cause the same kind of fatigue that a heavy hybrid would cause. In tandem with THC and CBD, it makes for a good daytime experience.</p>

<h3 id="cbc">Cannabichroneme</h3>

<p>This cannabinoid also binds poorly to the CB1 receptor, making it a relatively non-psychoactive compound, but in my opinion it is a hgihly underrated cannabinoid. It does bind with other receptors in the body. The vallinoid receptor 1 and transient receptor potential ankyrin are both linked to pain perception, and when CBC reacts with these receptors, the body increases the level of endocannabinoids it releases.</p>

<p>CBC is actually one of the primary cannabinoids that are associated with fighting cancer, having the same anti-tumor, anti-pain, pro-hunger effects that THC had without the psychoactive effects of THC, which can be disorienting for chemotherapy patients.</p>

<p>I tried CBC once and it was surprising - I don't usually feel too much from edibles (tolerance is a real thing), but I tried some Wyld 1:1 THC:CBC gummies, and since I have high tolerance, I went ahead and took 3. I honestly forgot about them and then maybe an hour later my whole face was buzzing, from my nose to my jaw and up my forehead - it was euphoric and creative and I was surprised as to how potent it was. But it wasn't disorienting, it was electrifying.</p>

<p>Honestly, CBC is a very interesting cannabinoid, and there will be more information on this soon, but if you're interested, most of my information (outside of my own use) came from <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/what-is-cannabichromene-cbc-cannabinoid">this Leafly page.</a>

<h2 id="others">Other-Delta THC</h2>

<p>I'm going to be a little biased here. Delta-8 THC, THC-V or THC-O... be careful with those things. I'm not going to spend too much time on them right now because I think that there is a certain amount of laboratory manipulation that keeps the plants pure, like cross-pollination, but the practices of creating "legal THC" are generally not included in legal cannabis. It can be frustrating. Know that Delta-9 THC is the "real" THC.</p>

<p>Side note for Budtenders and consumers who live or plan to purchase in Las Vegas: If the dispensary does not require you to scan your ID and enter a locked or monitored door, <em>it is not a legal cannabis dispensary, and it is likely they are selling CBD or Delta-8 THC</em>. Especially on Fremont Street, where they also sell Lion's Mane mushrooms as "shrooms", their cannabis is similarly deliberately misleading. Also, if the store is within 1000 feet of any place with a gaming license, it is likely not actual cannabis.</p>
